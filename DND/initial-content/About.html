        <p>Hi I'm Dave and this is my website. I developed the site initially as a way to showcase and enhance my web design skills but hope it becomes more than that.</p>
        <p>My aim is to use the website as a medium to share my journey to becoming a location independent Digital Nomad and information about my three main passions:</p>

        <h2>Travel</h2>
        <p>Since 2012, when I went on my first overseas trip to Europe I've had a severe case of the Travel Bug. Fast forward five years and I've now visited 47+ countries, worked in 2 countries and still haven't been able to find a cure.</p>
        <p>I'm definitely not a luxury traveller and instead prefer: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>travelling for as cheap as possible</li>
            <li>travelling for as long as possible</li>
            <li>seeing as much as possible</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This means the majority of my travel articles will have a budget theme and focus on giving informations such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Exact GPS co-ordinates</li>
            <li>Cost</li>
            <li>Time Required</li>
            <li>Useful tips</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Programming/Web Design</h2>
        <p>In the comining months I plan to to write blog articles about the places I visit, projects I complete and make code available that others might find useful. I have 7 years experience as a .NET Analyst Programmer with experience in Australian Higher Education, Australian and UK Financial Services (Superannuation) and more recently Responsive Web Development. I enjoy undertaking challenging business and technical tasks that utilize my technical knowledge & academic ability as well as creative front-end tasks using technologies such as CSS3, HTML5, JQuery, Angular, JSON and Web Services. In my spare time I enjoy keeping fit, taking photos, travelling the world, having a beer, watching the latest movies and coding.</p>
